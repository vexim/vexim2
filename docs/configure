######################################################################


# This is a default configuration file which will operate correctly in
# uncomplicated installations. Please see the manual for a complete list
# of all the runtime configuration options that can be included in a
# configuration file. There are many more than are mentioned here. The
# manual is in the file doc/spec.txt in the Exim distribution as a plain
# ASCII file. Other formats (PostScript, Texinfo, HTML, PDF) are available
# from the Exim ftp sites. The manual is also online at the Exim web sites.


# This file is divided into several parts, all but the first of which are
# headed by a line starting with the word "begin". Only those parts that
# are required need to be present. Blank lines, and lines starting with #
# are ignored.

# Whenever you change Exim's configuration file, you *must* remember to    #
# HUP the Exim daemon, because it will not pick up the new configuration   #
# until you do. However, any other Exim processes that are started, for    #
# example, a process started by an MUA in order to send a message, will    #
# see the new configuration as soon as it is in place.                     #
#                                                                          #
# You do not need to HUP the daemon for changes in auxiliary files that    #
# are referenced from this file. They are read every time they are used.   #

# It is usually a good idea to test a new configuration for syntactic      #

MAILMAN_GROUP=mail

# Specify your host's canonical name here. This should normally be the fully
# qualified "official" name of your host. If this option is not set, the
# uname() function is called to obtain the name. In many cases this does
# the right thing and you need not set anything explicitly.

# primary_hostname =

# The next three settings create two lists of domains and one list of hosts.
# These lists are referred to later in this configuration using the syntax
# +local_domains, +relay_to_domains, and +relay_from_hosts, respectively. They
# are all colon-separated lists:

# If you are using MySQL, uncomment the following two lines:
VIRTUAL_DOMAINS = SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT(domain, ' : ') FROM domains WHERE type = 'local' AND enabled = '1'
RELAY_DOMAINS = SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT(domain, ' : ') FROM domains WHERE type = 'relay'

# If you are using PGSQL, uncomment the following four lines:
#VIRTUAL_DOMAINS = SELECT DISTINCT domain || ' : ' FROM domains WHERE type = 'local'
#RELAY_DOMAINS = SELECT DISTINCT domain || ' : ' FROM domains WHERE type = 'relay'

domainlist local_domains = @ : pear.silverwraith.com : ${lookup mysql{VIRTUAL_DOMAINS}}
domainlist relay_to_domains = ${lookup mysql{RELAY_DOMAINS}}
hostlist   relay_from_hosts = localhost : 192.168.0.0/24

hide mysql_servers = localhost::(/tmp/mysql.sock)/vexim/vexim/CHANGE
#hide pgsql_servers = localhost/vexim/vexim/CHANGE

# Most straightforward access control requirements can be obtained by
# appropriate settings of the above options. In more complicated situations, you
# may need to modify the Access Control List (ACL) which appears later in this
# file.

# The first setting specifies your local domains, for example:
#
#   domainlist local_domains = my.first.domain : my.second.domain
#
# You can use "@" to mean "the name of the local host", as in the default
# setting above. This is the name that is specified by primary_hostname,
# as specified above (or defaulted). If you do not want to do any local
# deliveries, remove the "@" from the setting above. If you want to accept mail
# addressed to your host's literal IP address, for example, mail addressed to
# "user@[192.168.23.44]", you can add "@[]" as an item in the local domains
# list. You also need to uncomment "allow_domain_literals" below. This is not
# recommended for today's Internet.

# The second setting specifies domains for which your host is an incoming relay.
# If you are not doing any relaying, you should leave the list empty. However,
# if your host is an MX backup or gateway of some kind for some domains, you
# must set relay_to_domains to match those domains. For example:
#
# domainlist relay_to_domains = *.myco.com : my.friend.org
#
# This will allow any host to relay through your host to those domains.
# See the section of the manual entitled "Control of relaying" for more
# information.

# The third setting specifies hosts that can use your host as an outgoing relay
# to any other host on the Internet. Such a setting commonly refers to a
# complete local network as well as the localhost. For example:
#
# hostlist relay_from_hosts = 127.0.0.1 : 192.168.0.0/16
#
# The "/16" is a bit mask (CIDR notation), not a number of hosts. Note that you
# have to include 127.0.0.1 if you want to allow processes on your host to send
# SMTP mail by using the loopback address. A number of MUAs use this method of
# sending mail.


# All three of these lists may contain many different kinds of item, including
# wildcarded names, regular expressions, and file lookups. See the reference
# manual for details. The lists above are used in the access control list for
# incoming messages. The name of this ACL is defined here:

acl_smtp_rcpt = acl_check_rcpt

# You should not change that setting until you understand how ACLs work.

# The following ACL entry is used if you want to do content scanning with the
# exiscan-acl patch. When you uncomment this line, you must also review the
# acl_check_content entry in the ACL section further below.

acl_smtp_data = acl_check_content

# This configuration variable defines the virus scanner that is used with
# the 'malware' ACL condition of the exiscan acl-patch. If you do not use
# virus scanning, leave it commented. Please read doc/exiscan-acl-readme.txt
# for a list of supported scanners.

av_scanner = clamd:/tmp/clamd

# The following setting is only needed if you use the 'spam' ACL condition
# of the exiscan-acl patch. It specifies on which host and port the SpamAssassin
# "spamd" daemon is listening. If you do not use this condition, or you use
# the default of "127.0.0.1 783", you can omit this option.

spamd_address = 127.0.0.1 783

# Specify the domain you want to be added to all unqualified addresses
# here. An unqualified address is one that does not contain an "@" character
# followed by a domain. For example, "caesar@rome.example" is a fully qualified
# address, but the string "caesar" (i.e. just a login name) is an unqualified
# email address. Unqualified addresses are accepted only from local callers by
# default. See the recipient_unqualified_hosts option if you want to permit
# unqualified addresses from remote sources. If this option is not set, the
# primary_hostname value is used for qualification.

# qualify_domain =


# If you want unqualified recipient addresses to be qualified with a different
# domain to unqualified sender addresses, specify the recipient domain here.
# If this option is not set, the qualify_domain value is used.

# qualify_recipient =


# The following line must be uncommented if you want Exim to recognize
# addresses of the form "user@[10.11.12.13]" that is, with a "domain literal"
# (an IP address) instead of a named domain. The RFCs still require this form,
# but it makes little sense to permit mail to be sent to specific hosts by
# their IP address in the modern Internet. This ancient format has been used
# by those seeking to abuse hosts by using them for unwanted relaying. If you
# really do want to support domain literals, uncomment the following line, and
# see also the "domain_literal" router below.

# allow_domain_literals


# No deliveries will ever be run under the uids of these users (a colon-
# separated list). An attempt to do so causes a panic error to be logged, and
# the delivery to be deferred. This is a paranoic safety catch. Note that the
# default setting means you cannot deliver mail addressed to root as if it
# were a normal user. This isn't usually a problem, as most sites have an alias
# for root that redirects such mail to a human administrator.

exim_user = mailnull
exim_group = mail
never_users = root


# The setting below causes Exim to do a reverse DNS lookup on all incoming
# IP calls, in order to get the true host name. If you feel this is too
# expensive, you can specify the networks for which a lookup is done, or
# remove the setting entirely.

host_lookup = *


# The settings below, which are actually the same as the defaults in the
# code, cause Exim to make RFC 1413 (ident) callbacks for all incoming SMTP
# calls. You can limit the hosts to which these calls are made, and/or change
# the timeout that is used. If you set the timeout to zero, all RFC 1413 calls
# are disabled. RFC 1413 calls are cheap and can provide useful information
# for tracing problem messages, but some hosts and firewalls have problems
# with them. This can result in a timeout instead of an immediate refused
# connection, leading to delays on starting up an SMTP session.

rfc1413_hosts = *
rfc1413_query_timeout = 30s


# By default, Exim expects all envelope addresses to be fully qualified, that
# is, they must contain both a local part and a domain. If you want to accept
# unqualified addresses (just a local part) from certain hosts, you can specify
# these hosts by setting one or both of
#
# sender_unqualified_hosts =
# recipient_unqualified_hosts =
#
# to control sender and recipient addresses, respectively. When this is done,
# unqualified addresses are qualified using the settings of qualify_domain
# and/or qualify_recipient (see above).


# If you want Exim to support the "percent hack" for certain domains,
# uncomment the following line and provide a list of domains. The "percent
# hack" is the feature by which mail addressed to x%y@z (where z is one of
# the domains listed) is locally rerouted to x@y and sent on. If z is not one
# of the "percent hack" domains, x%y is treated as an ordinary local part. This
# hack is rarely needed nowadays; you should not enable it unless you are sure
# that you really need it.
#
# percent_hack_domains =
#
# As well as setting this option you will also need to remove the test
# for local parts containing % in the ACL definition below.


# When Exim can neither deliver a message nor return it to sender, it "freezes"
# the delivery error message (aka "bounce message"). There are also other
# circumstances in which messages get frozen. They will stay on the queue for
# ever unless one of the following options is set.

# This option unfreezes frozen bounce messages after two days, tries
# once more to deliver them, and ignores any delivery failures.

ignore_bounce_errors_after = 2d

# This option cancels (removes) frozen messages that are older than a week.

timeout_frozen_after = 7d


# We also want a little more detail in our logs, helps with debugging

# This router routes to remote hosts over SMTP by explicit IP address,
# when an email address is given in "domain literal" form, for example,
# <user@[192.168.35.64]>. The RFCs require this facility. However, it is
# little-known these days, and has been exploited by evil people seeking
# to abuse SMTP relays. Consequently it is commented out in the default
# configuration. If you uncomment this router, you also need to uncomment
# allow_domain_literals above, so that Exim can recognize the syntax of
# domain literal addresses.

# domain_literal:
#   driver = ipliteral
#   domains = ! +local_domains
#   transport = remote_smtp


# This router routes addresses that are not in local domains by doing a DNS
# lookup on the domain name. Any domain that resolves to 0.0.0.0 or to a
# loopback interface address (127.0.0.0/8) is treated as if it had no DNS
# entry. Note that 0.0.0.0 is the same as 0.0.0.0/32, which is commonly treated
# as the local host inside the network stack. It is not 0.0.0.0/0, the default
# route. If the DNS lookup fails, no further routers are tried because of
# the no_more setting, and consequently the address is unrouteable.

# The remaining routers handle addresses in the local domain(s).

# The virtual_domains alias, queries your given mysql database
# and requests the home directory of the user's maildir, the
# UID and the GID of the process to deliver under. You can be
# clever, and set the UID and GID of a user, to that of a
# local system user, so they can check their mail locally,
# rather than having to over a network. Three different
# transports are specified. virtual_delivery delivers if the
# home directory is a given directory on a locally accessible
# file system. address_reply is called if the home directory
# returns an email address (making the rcpt address an alias).
# finally, pipe_transport is used to pipe the mail to a
# process.

# This router caused me so much s*** it's untrue.
# If your db lookup returns 'no data', then $spam_in_score is
# greater than no data, and mail gets deleted.

# This router handles forwarding using traditional .forward files in users'

# file starts with the string "# Exim filter", uncomment the "allow_filter"
# option.

# The no_verify setting means that this router is skipped when Exim is
# verifying addresses. Similarly, no_expn means that this router is skipped if
# Exim is processing an EXPN command.

# The check_ancestor option means that if the forward file generates an
# address that is an ancestor of the current one, the current one gets
# passed on instead. This covers the case where A is aliased to B and B
# has a .forward file pointing to A.

# The three transports specified at the end are those that are used when
# forwarding generates a direct delivery to a file, or to a pipe, or sets
# up an auto-reply, respectively.
